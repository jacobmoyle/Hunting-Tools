# Hunting-Tools
A compilation of all the tools/resources that have kept me sane and on the warpath. I'm going to start by barfing links, then add opinions, experiences, and formatting over time.

## Table of Contents
1. [Helpful Tools](#helpful-tools)
2. [Resume Assistance](#resume-assistance)
3. [Personal Growth](#personal-growth)
4. [Techical Growth](#techical-growth)
5. [Finding the Jobs](#finding-jobs)
6. [The Interview](#the-interview)

## Helpful Tools
* [Video Speed Controller](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/video-speed-controller/nffaoalbilbmmfgbnbgppjihopabppdk?hl=en)
* [Trello](https://trello.com/b/I7TjiplA/trello-tutorial)
  * [Copy of my old board](https://trello.com/b/eVHZ331j/joblistcopy) <- Hopefully there's nothing embarrasing in there but you get an idea of how I used it to manage/track my applications. Feel free to reach out to any of the companies as well (if there's still around).
* [Pomodoro Technique](http://pomodorotechnique.com/)

## Resume Assistance
* [Creddle](http://creddle.io/)
  * Free resume builder. Kinda glitchy but helpful for formatting if you don't like using tables in docs or something. **BEWARE:** I've heard that having information split into two columns does not play well with resume scrapers.
* [TopResume](https://www.topresume.com/)
  * Free resume review. Feedback seems to vary, but generally, feedback is about layout and action words.

## Personal Growth
* **Videos:**
  * The following videos are aimed more at IT folks but I found some of the information helpful:
      * [Setting up Boundaries as a Tech Professional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sE4a3ZwWeOA)
      * [Job Satisfaction as a Tech Professional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyXv1sZqjYQ)

    * If you have a San Francisco Library card, TeamTreeHouse is **free** - Bring proof of California state residency to the front desk to receive a card.
      * Treehouse is an excellent way to become exposed to a language, but I never felt like it made me fluent. I've found that doing a Treehouse course and then an in-depth todo app tutorial is the best way to learn something new.

## The Interview
A helpful email was written by a recruiter from Hired:

> Pick the projects you feel most confident and passionate about discussing. Ensure your answers are concise and leave room to go into more detail when appropriate.

> Ask for further clarification on any technical questions before attacking the answer. Doing so will help you better understand how to approach the problem and will also allow you to demonstrate your thought process to the interviewer.  Here are 3 resources to use that will enable you to practice for technical [interviews](https://www.interviewcake.com/ AND Technical Interview Cheat Sheet (https://gist.github.com/TSiege/cbb0507082bb18ff7e4b))

> Have 3-5 engaging questions lined up - it shows you are inquisitive and committed to learning more about their business. Also, don't ask the same problems of each person if possible.  Use this resource as a prep [tool](http://www.forbes.com/sites/nextavenue/2014/06/18/10-job-interview-questions-you-should-ask/)

> Always be positive. Never disparage a current or previous employer or colleague.

> Research the company and familiarize yourself with their product and services. If you can identify bugs or issues, this shows you are thinking strategically about how to improve their business and immediately add value to the team. Determine if they have competitors and ask them.

> Be sure to arrive on time, which means at least 5-10 minutes early (confirm the address and map out your route the night before). If you are using public transportation, arrive earlier to account for potential traffic delays.

> After you confirm your onsite, ask for an outline of your interview schedule, so you know what to expect. Research any people you may be meeting with, either via LinkedIn or on the company's website. It will help you feel more comfortable & confident going into the interview process.

> I know interviewing can be stressful. Try to relax, smile, and enjoy the process. This will help employers get a better understanding of who you are and what you bring to the table.

> Last, but not least, always remember to write a follow-up Thank You note by the next day to each person that you met/spoke with.
