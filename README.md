# Finding Jobs

## Resumes
<ul>
  <li> Creddle: http://creddle.io/ </il>
  <ul>
    <li> Free resume builder. Kinda glitchy but helpful for formatting if you don't like using tables in docs or something. <b>BEWARE:</b> I've heard that having information split into two columns does not play well with resume scrapers. </li>
  </ul>
  <li> TopResume: https://www.topresume.com/ </li>
  <ul>
      <li> Free resume review. Feedback seems to vary but generally feedback is about resume layout and action words.</il>

# The Interview

A helpful email written by a recruiter from Hired:

"Pick the projects you feel most confident and passionate about discussing. Ensure your answers are concise and leave room to go into more detail when appropriate.

Ask for further clarification on any technical questions before attacking the answer. Doing so will help you better understand how to approach the problem and will also allow you to demonstrate your thought process to the interviewer.  Here are 3 resources to use that allows you to practice for technical interviews: https://www.interviewcake.com/ AND Technical Interview Cheat Sheet (https://gist.github.com/TSiege/cbb0507082bb18ff7e4b)

Have 3-5 engaging questions lined up - it shows you are inquisitive and committed to learning more about their business. Also don't ask the same questions of each person if possible.  Use this resource as a prep tool: http://www.forbes.com/sites/nextavenue/2014/06/18/10-job-interview-questions-you-should-ask/

Always be positive. Never disparage a current or previous employer or colleague.

Research the company and familiarize yourself with their product and services. If you can identify bugs or issues, this shows you are thinking strategically about how to improve their business and immediately add value to the team. Determine if they have competitors and ask them.

Be sure to arrive on time which means at least 5-10 minutes early (confirm the address and map out your route the night before). If you are using public transportation, arrive earlier to account for potential traffic delays.

After you confirm your onsite, ask for an outline of your interview schedule so you know what to expect. Research any people you may be meeting with, either via LinkedIn or on the company's website. It will help you feel more comfortable & confident going into the interview process.

I know interviewing can be stressful. Try to relax, smile, and enjoy the process. This will help employers get a better understanding of who you are and what you bring to the table.

Last, but not least, always remember to write a follow-up Thank You note by the next day to each person that you met/spoke with."
